CS337TeamBestia contains all the components and source code for the Navsea web application. 
The source code contained here is the html for the user interface for the home page, login, 
registration, upload and dowload page. There are java script files that are the controllers for 
all the html files that will get information from end users and interact with the database. 
The repository also contains all the dependencies in order to run the web application. 
The dependencies consist of the database, which is mongoDB, and the server environment where 
the web application will be deployed, which is Sails.js. Sails.js is very good for making 
an application that follows the MVC architecture that many standard web applications 
implement. The use of the MVC framework makes it possible to implement many other libraries
in the web application. 
When you run the web application, the user interface will interact with the controllers 
that will interact with the database so front end aspects and back end aspects are completely 
integrated in this respository. Much of the java script that you will find in the source code is 
integrated with polymerJS. Polymer makes different functionalities very efficient and events 
happen in real time. The use of PolymerJS makes the retrival of information 
from the front end to the back end processing and query of information very simple and keeps 
processing time and space costs to a minimum.
